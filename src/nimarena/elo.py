"""A tiny, self-contained Elo rating implementation.

Elo is used by the **league** tournament format (see :mod:`nimarena.tournament`)
to rank players by a rating that reflects *who* they beat, not just how many
games they won. Ratings are updated **one game at a time**, in play order, so the
result is order-dependent — the tournament always feeds games in a deterministic
order, keeping the ratings reproducible.

NIM (normal play) can never end in a draw, so only the win/loss outcome matters;
the draw score of ``0.5`` is supported for completeness but never produced here.
