"""The player API — the spine of the whole project.

Everything (the tournament, the web page, and every externally submitted bot)
depends on this one small interface. A player declares **who it is** and
implements **one method**, :meth:`Player.choose_move`.

Keeping the move contract tiny is a feature: every extra parameter is one more
thing an outsider can get wrong. Concerns that belong to the *caller* — timeouts,
move history, opponent identity — deliberately live in the tournament, not here.

There are two other things a player must provide, and both exist because the
*caller* needs them, not because the bot does:

**Identity.** :meth:`~Player.get_name`, :meth:`~Player.get_authors` and
:meth:`~Player.get_description` are ``classmethod``\\ s, so the tournament, the
docs and the web app can all read a player's identity **without constructing
it**. They are abstract, which means :class:`abc.ABCMeta` refuses to instantiate
a subclass that has not filled them in::

    TypeError: Can't instantiate abstract class MyBot without an implementation
               for abstract method 'get_name'

**Construction.** :meth:`~Player.create` is the *only* way the tournament builds
a player, and it receives only a ``seed``. A bot is free to ignore the seed (a
deterministic bot has nothing to seed), but every bot is offered one, so repeated
games can differ. Because ``create`` is a classmethod, a bot may also use the
seed to vary its own configuration.

Why a factory rather than a ``seed`` parameter on every ``__init__``: it keeps a
tournament concern out of the signature every author has to write, and it gives
the caller one uniform construction path instead of inspecting signatures to see
which bots accept what.
