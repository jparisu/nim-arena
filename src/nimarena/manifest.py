"""Manifest-based player discovery.

Players are discovered from **explicit, human-edited manifests** — never by
auto-scanning a folder. This is a deliberate design choice: when someone opens a
PR to add a bot, the reviewer sees, in a single diff, both the new file and the
one line that admits it. That legibility *is* the security gate; auto-importing a
directory would hide what is being admitted and would run a stranger's top-level
code merely to discover it.

There are **two** manifests, each next to the players it admits::

    players/
      builtin/players.yaml   the reference ladder that ships with the project
      custom/players.yaml    everything submitted by pull request

The split is not cosmetic. It keeps a submission's diff inside ``custom/``, so no
two submissions collide in the same manifest and none of them can touch the
reference ladder. It also tells the tournament which players are which, which is
what decides how many roster copies each one is entered with (see
:data:`~nimarena.tournament.BUILTIN_PLAYER_COPIES` and
:data:`~nimarena.tournament.CUSTOM_PLAYER_COPIES`).

A manifest is purely an **admission list**: which file, and which class in it.
Nothing else::

    players:
      - file: random.py    # path to the .py file (see resolution below)
        class: Random      # the Player subclass to admit

A player's *identity* — name, authors, description — is declared by the class
itself, via :meth:`~nimarena.player.Player.get_name` and friends. Keeping it there
rather than here means there is exactly one source of truth: a submission cannot
claim one name in the manifest and another in the code, and there is nothing to
drift. The manifest answers "is this admitted?"; the class answers "what is it?".

Path resolution for ``file``:

* A bare filename (e.g. ``random_bot.py``) is resolved **next to its own
  manifest**, so an entry in ``players/custom/players.yaml`` names a file in
  ``players/custom/``.
* A path with a separator (e.g. ``community/foo/bar.py``) is resolved relative
  to the repo root.

Loading a player *imports its file*, which runs that file's top-level code. That
is expected and safe **only because** files arrive through reviewed PRs.
